                  <br> In our Union of Prayer, we will model our hierarchy after the knight’s ranks during the Medieval times. We will have three ranks building up to the Knights and Ladies ranking. For the Knights: Pages, Squires and ultimately Knights.
                  For the Ladies: Maid, Ladies-in-Waiting, and ultimately Ladies. Every member entering the Union of Prayer will start at the lowest level and work towards the highest level. Each rank will have a minimum service requirement and be required
                  to write a request of permission documenting why they would like to be elevated to the next rank. There is a minimum age requirement for each level; however, there is no time restraint on how long a member can be at one particular rank.</div>

                  <div style="text-align:center;">Pages and Maids:</div>
                  <br> This is the introduction rank. Boys and men will be called Pages; girls and women will be designated as Maids. All members will be started at this rank regardless of age. Each member must complete 40 hours of service to the community
                  before advancing to the next rank. (The 40 hours reminds us of the 40 days and nights Jesus spent in desert before the start of ministry.) Once these 40 hours have been completed and documented, the Page or Maid may submit a written
                  petition to advance to the next rank. The Page or Maid must be at least 13 in order to advance to the next rank. After reviewing the written request, the Page or Maid will be called forth for an interview. During the interview, the Page
                  and Maid will be required to recite the Knights and Ladies of Chivalry Code of Conduct, the mission statement, and their promise to defend life, marriage, families, and religious freedom. During the ranking ceremony, they will be again
                  asked to recite the code, mission statement, and their promise. In addition they would also present to the ceremonial audience a description and report of the service project that made the most impact on their life. At the completion
                  of the ceremony, they would be advanced to the next rank as a Squire or Lady-in-Waiting.</div>

                  <br> As a middle ranking member the young men and men will be called Squires; young ladies and women will be designated as Ladies-in-Waiting. A member must be at least 13 before reaching this rank. Each member must complete 70 hours of service
                  to the community before advancing to the next rank. (The 70 hours reminds us of the 70 disciples Jesus sent into the surrounding areas as his witnesses.) Once these 70 hours have been completed and documented, the Squire or Lady-in-Waiting
                  may submit a written petition and fill out the application to advance to the next rank. The Squire or Lady-in-Waiting must be at least 18 in order to advance to the next rank. After reviewing the written request and application, the
                  Squire or Lady-in-Waiting will be called forth for an interview. During the interview, the Squire and Lady-in-Waiting will be required answer a series of questions in order to determine that he/she will abide by the code of conduct and
                  agrees with the statutes in regards to life, marriage, families, and religious freedom. They will also be called upon to recite the Knights and Ladies of Chivalry Code of Conduct, the mission statement, and their promise to defend life,
                  marriage, families, and religious freedom. During the ranking ceremony, they will be again asked to recite the code, mission statement, and their promise. In addition, they will be required to recite the prayer for protection of life,
                  the prayer for families, the prayer for marriage, and the prayer for religious freedom. They will also have to describe the coat of arms and the symbolization of each item from memory. Finally they would give a presentation to the ceremonial
                  audience on the service project or event that made the most impact on their life and the lives of the community. At the completion of the ceremony, they would be advanced to the next rank as a Knight or Lady.</div>

                  <br> As the highest ranking title member the men will be called Knights and the women will be designated as Ladies. A member must be at least 18 before reaching this rank. Although this is the highest title someone may achieve, there are
                  various ranks that a Knight or Lady may reach within this title. Veritatis et Veritate Knight or Lady Status: To achieve the Veritatis et Veritate rank, the Knight or Lady must demonstrate truth and loyalty. The loyalty of a Knight or
                  Lady will be measured by the Knight’s or Lady’s loyalty to the Union of Prayer. Loyalty will be displayed by regularly attending meetings, organizing events, serving the community, and attending events. A 75% attendance rate will be
                  required to meet the status of Veritatis et Veritate for a minimum of 18 months. The Knight or Lady must show supportiveness, dignity, honesty, and sincerity in living out the Code of Conduct, mission statement, and promise to support
                  life, marriage families, and religious freedom. To achieve this rank a minimum of 89 service hours must be completed (89 reminds of the 89 books that make up the four gospels of Good News). The Knight or Lady must submit a written request
                  to advance to the next level. After reviewing the written request, the Knight or Lady will be called forth for an interview. During the interview, the Knight and Lady will be required to answer questions related to truth and loyalty

                  as training them to lead events. The Knight/Lady will also need to have written a letter to our political figures requesting that they too defend life, marriage, and religious freedom at some point during the course of their being a

                  in Him shall have everlasting life). The Knight or Lady must submit a written request to advance to the next level. After reviewing the written request, the Knight or Lady will be called forth for an interview. During the interview,

                to living our lives in outstanding conduct in our families, communities, state, and country. We will also be committed to praying for the protection of life in all its stages, the safeguard of marriage, the fortification of families, and
                the preservation of religious freedom. The Knights and Ladies of Chivalry will follow the same code of conduct used by the knights while serving families and communities, sharing the love of Jesus, and loving those around us.

                to write a request of permission documenting why they would like to be elevated to the next rank. There is a minimum age requirement for each level; however, there is no time restraint on how long a member can be at one particular rank.
                <br> Pages and Maids:
                <br> This is the introduction rank. Boys and men will be called Pages; girls and women will be designated as Maids. All members will be started at this rank regardless of age. Each member must complete 40 hours of service to the community
                before advancing to the next rank. (The 40 hours reminds us of the 40 days and nights Jesus spent in desert before the start of ministry.) Once these 40 hours have been completed and documented, the Page or Maid may submit a written petition
                to advance to the next rank. The Page or Maid must be at least 13 in order to advance to the next rank. After reviewing the written request, the Page or Maid will be called forth for an interview. During the interview, the Page and Maid
                will be required to recite the Knights and Ladies of Chivalry Code of Conduct, the mission statement, and their promise to defend life, marriage, families, and religious freedom. During the ranking ceremony, they will be again asked to
                recite the code, mission statement, and their promise. In addition they would also present to the ceremonial audience a description and report of the service project that made the most impact on their life. At the completion of the ceremony,
                they would be advanced to the next rank as a Squire or Lady-in-Waiting.
                <br> Squires and Ladies-in-Waiting:
                <br> As a middle ranking member the young men and men will be called Squires; young ladies and women will be designated as Ladies-in-Waiting. A member must be at least 13 before reaching this rank. Each member must complete 70 hours of service
                to the community before advancing to the next rank. (The 70 hours reminds us of the 70 disciples Jesus sent into the surrounding areas as his witnesses.) Once these 70 hours have been completed and documented, the Squire or Lady-in-Waiting
                may submit a written petition and fill out the application to advance to the next rank. The Squire or Lady-in-Waiting must be at least 18 in order to advance to the next rank. After reviewing the written request and application, the Squire
                or Lady-in-Waiting will be called forth for an interview. During the interview, the Squire and Lady-in-Waiting will be required answer a series of questions in order to determine that he/she will abide by the code of conduct and agrees
                with the statutes in regards to life, marriage, families, and religious freedom. They will also be called upon to recite the Knights and Ladies of Chivalry Code of Conduct, the mission statement, and their promise to defend life, marriage,
                families, and religious freedom. During the ranking ceremony, they will be again asked to recite the code, mission statement, and their promise. In addition, they will be required to recite the prayer for protection of life, the prayer
                for families, the prayer for marriage, and the prayer for religious freedom. They will also have to describe the coat of arms and the symbolization of each item from memory. Finally they would give a presentation to the ceremonial audience
                on the service project or event that made the most impact on their life and the lives of the community. At the completion of the ceremony, they would be advanced to the next rank as a Knight or Lady.
                <br> Knights and Ladies:
                <br> As the highest ranking title member the men will be called Knights and the women will be designated as Ladies. A member must be at least 18 before reaching this rank. Although this is the highest title someone may achieve, there are various
                ranks that a Knight or Lady may reach within this title. Fide et Veritate Knight or Lady Status: To achieve the Fide et Veritate rank, the Knight or Lady must demonstrate truth and loyalty. The loyalty of a Knight or Lady will be measured
                by the Knight’s or Lady’s loyalty to the Union of Prayer. Loyalty will be displayed by regularly attending meetings, organizing events, serving the community, and attending events. A 75% attendance rate will be required to meet the status
